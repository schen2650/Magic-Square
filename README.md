# Magic-Square

One of the major projects in my Intro to Comp Sci II course using Java with NetBeans IDE.

This program detects whether integer values stored in a 2D array form a magic square, using loops.

A magic square consists of numbers in a square grid in which the sum of the numbers in
each column, row, and diagonal are the same.
